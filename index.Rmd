### About

**Statistics Graduate Student Research Day** is an annual conference organized by graduate students in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto. The event celebrates and showcases the exciting work of graduate students in the areas of statistics, mathematical sciences, and actuarial science. This conference also serves as a valuable networking opportunity, bringing together students from across disciplines to connect with the broader statistical sciences community.  

This year’s event will take place in person at the Department of Statistical Sciences, located on the **9th floor of the Ontario Power Building, 700 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1Z5**. The talks and poster session will be held in the Maple and Cherry Rooms (9014 and 9016). A small breakfast (pastries and coffee) will be provided at 9:30 a.m. Opening remarks will begin at 9:45 a.m., followed by the first round of talks at 10:00 a.m. Lunch will be provided at 12:45 p.m. The poster session will be held at 2:30 p.m. The conference will conclude at approximately 5:00 p.m., after the closing remarks.  

The schedule can be found [here](schedule.html). The event has four thematic blocks, corresponding to the main research areas in our department: Theoretical Statistics, Applied Statistics, Mathematical Finance and Actuarial Science, and Graphical Models. The abstracts can be found [here](abstracts.html). If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to a member of the organizing committee.

### Land Acknowledgment

We respectfully acknowledge the land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years, it has been the traditional territory of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place remains home to many Indigenous peoples from across Turtle Island, and we are grateful for the opportunity to work and learn on this land.
